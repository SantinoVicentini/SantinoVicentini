## 👨‍💻 About me
I’m a **Data Scientist** with a strong background in **Machine Learning and Data Analysis**, focused on building **end-to-end predictive models** to solve real-world problems and support data-driven decision making.

I have experience working with structured data, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and optimization, applying machine learning to **classification and regression problems**.

I’m particularly interested in **ML applied to product, business optimization and decision-making**, and I’m currently looking for **full-time opportunities** (preferably remote).
